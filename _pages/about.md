I'm a PhD student from [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI)](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Liu](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/liuyong). 

I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from [School of Information](https://info.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/) when I was advised by [Prof. Zhao](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Suyun) from [DW&BI Lab](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/jsky/xsky/kytd/jsx/sjckyswznsys/index.htm).
